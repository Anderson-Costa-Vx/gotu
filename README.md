Entities are the first natural place we should aim to place business logic in domain-driven applications.

Yard helps you define your business entities in your code.

```javascript
const entity_ = 
    entity('User', {
        name: field(String),
        lastAccess: field(Date),
        accessCount: field(Number),
        hasAccess: field(Boolean)
    })
```

## Field definition

A entity field type has a name, type and validation.

### Scalar types

A field in an entity can be of basic types, the same as those used by JavaScript:

`Number`: Number type is double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754 value

`String`: A UTF‚Äê16 character sequence

`Boolean`: true or false

`Date`: represents a single moment in time in a platform-independent format. 

```javascript
const entity_ = 
    entity('User', {
        name: field(String),
        lastAccess: field(Date),
        accessCount: field(Number),
        hasAccess: field(Boolean)
    })
```
